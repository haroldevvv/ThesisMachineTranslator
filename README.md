## Undergraduate Thesis Project

This repository contains the source code and experimental setup for the undergraduate thesis entitled:

> **AI-Driven Synthetic Data for Low-Resource Translation: Enhancing Rinconada-to-English Translation**

conducted by:

- **Harold M. Salvador**  
- **Mary Rachel L. Parañal**  
- **Paolo L. Espion**

and submitted to the **College of Computer Studies, Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges** in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**

## Project Overview

Low-resource languages presented significant challenges in machine translation due to the scarcity of parallel corpora.  
This study investigated the use of **AI-driven synthetic data generation techniques** to improve translation quality for **Rinconada-to-English** machine translation.

The research explored and compared multiple translation strategies, including:

- Direct Machine Translation  
- Pivot-Based Machine Translation  
- Synthetic Data Augmentation  
- Prototype Translation Models  

The project emphasized modular implementation, controlled experimentation, and reproducibility.
